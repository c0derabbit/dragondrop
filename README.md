# dragondrop
üêâ drag'n'drop photo gallery

powered by 11ty, should work like magic :sparkles: 

1. create a folder in `src/photos/`
2. pop in some photos
3. maybe an `info.json` too
4. enjoy!

`info.json` example:
```json
{
  "title": "Birthday party",
  "description": "We had so much fun"
}
```
everything is optional.
